# DIBS
A Dictionary of Interacting Binary Stars, build for experts and beginners where anyone can contribute. The webpage is live at https://gmzsebastian.github.io/DIBS

This is the procedure I follow to add a new article to DIBS

- Create a new page in \Dictionary\newpage.html.
- The formal of the title is no capital letters, and dashes instead of spaces.
- Add the name of the new page to the Dictionary.html index of pages.
- Add the name of the new page to the References.html list of pages.
- Write the article, gather references and check for grammar.
- Write all the references, if possible from ADS, and write them in References.html
- The format is (Smith et al. 2010), (Smith 2010), or (Smith & Jones 2010)
- Replace the words in the new article that have a definiton in DIBS with the linked version found in References.html
- If using an image make sure to give credit.
- Check that the webpage looks good and compile.
